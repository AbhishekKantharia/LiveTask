## Angular:

### Product Listing Page:

Create a component in Angular to display the product listing page
In the component, use Angular's HTTPClient module to make API calls to the Rest API to fetch the products
Use Angular's built-in directives and services such as ngFor and ngIf to loop through the products and display the necessary information
Implement pagination using Angular's built-in libraries or third-party libraries
Use Angular's event binding and two-way data binding to handle the "Add to Cart" button click event

### Category Page:

Create a component in Angular to display the category page
In the component, use Angular's HTTPClient module to make API calls to the Rest API to fetch the category information
Use Angular's built-in directives and services such as ngFor to loop through the categories and display the information
Rest API:

## API's:

Implement the API endpoints using a framework such as Express or Flask
Use MongoDB as the database and connect to it using a MongoDB driver such as Mongoose
Create API endpoints to create products and categories, retrieve products and categories information, and implement the one-to-many relationship between categories and products
Use RESTful principles and HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to handle the API requests

## MongoDB:

- Store the products and categories information in the MongoDB database
- Use MongoDB's schema and relationships to define the necessary structure and relationships between the products and categories

Note:- This is just a basic outline and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements.
